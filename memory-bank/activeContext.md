# Active Context - Foothills Backend Development

## Current Phase: Phase 2 - Core Infrastructure Setup

### Current Focus
- Setting up database connection with MongoDB and Mongoose
- Enhancing Express server configuration
- Implementing core middleware (rate limiting, error handling)
- Creating basic routing structure
- Setting up environment configuration

### Recent Achievements
1. **Phase 1 Completed Successfully**:
   - ✅ Node.js project initialized with all dependencies
   - ✅ Express version compatibility issue resolved (fixed Express 5.x → 4.x)
   - ✅ Project directory structure created
   - ✅ Basic Express server running on port 3000
   - ✅ Health check endpoint working correctly
   - ✅ Comprehensive README.md created
   - ✅ Git repository initialized

2. **Server Status**: Running successfully at http://localhost:3000
3. **Health Check**: Responding correctly with API status
4. **Dependencies**: All core and dev dependencies installed and working

### Next Steps (Phase 2)
1. **Database Configuration**
   - Set up MongoDB connection with Mongoose
   - Create database configuration file
   - Test database connectivity
   - Set up connection event handlers

2. **Enhanced Server Configuration**
   - Add rate limiting middleware
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Set up request logging
   - Configure environment-specific settings

3. **Middleware Setup**
   - Authentication middleware structure
   - Validation middleware framework
   - Error handling middleware
   - Request/response formatting

4. **Basic Routing Structure**
   - Set up route organization
   - Create route index files
   - Implement basic route handlers
   - Set up API versioning

### Current Considerations
- **Database Setup**: Need to ensure MongoDB is running locally
- **Environment Variables**: Need to create .env file for local development
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling from the start
- **Security**: Continue with security best practices
- **Scalability**: Ensure architecture supports future growth

### Implementation Priority for Phase 2
1. **High Priority**: Database connection and configuration
2. **High Priority**: Enhanced error handling middleware
3. **Medium Priority**: Rate limiting and security middleware
4. **Medium Priority**: Basic routing structure
5. **Low Priority**: Request logging and monitoring

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Express Version**: Using Express 4.18.2 for stability
- **Project Structure**: Following the planned directory structure
- **Health Check**: Implemented as first endpoint for monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Global error handler with consistent response format

### Success Metrics for Phase 2
- Database connection established and tested
- All middleware properly configured and working
- Basic routing structure in place
- Enhanced error handling implemented
- Server configuration optimized for development

### Blockers
- None currently identified

### Notes
- Phase 1 completed ahead of schedule
- Express compatibility issue resolved quickly
- Ready to proceed with database integration
- Server foundation is solid and ready for enhancement

### Open Questions for Discussion
1. **Booking Logic**: How complex should the availability checking be?
2. **User Roles**: Should we implement role-based access control from the start?
3. **Payment Integration**: Will payment processing be part of MVP or future phase?
4. **Notifications**: Should we include email/SMS notifications in MVP?
5. **File Uploads**: Will services need image uploads for service photos?

### Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Core authentication and user management
2. **High Priority**: Basic booking system with availability checking
3. **Medium Priority**: Service and category management
4. **Medium Priority**: Advanced booking features (cancellation, rescheduling)
5. **Low Priority**: Admin dashboard endpoints
6. **Future**: Payment integration, notifications, file uploads

### Technical Debt Considerations
- Start with simple validation, enhance later
- Basic error handling initially, comprehensive later
- Simple logging, structured logging later
- Basic rate limiting, advanced later

### Success Metrics for MVP
- All CRUD operations working
- Authentication system secure and functional
- Booking system handles basic scenarios
- API response times under 200ms
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive Postman test coverage
